LAUNCHER
- Test MacOS version.
- Make Launcher use local config.txt file if possible (to avoid possible permision denied errors).
	Automatically generate it of it doesn't exist
	Use only when there are no permisions to edit the file.

GUI
- Add a LoadingBar widget.
- Make buttons with press layer (not only over)
- Make a pause system.
- Make SplitWindow system for Window.
- Fix bug with Labels scale/position on Render->Display->Scale Mode.

MEDIA
- Add adjustable latterbox with transition effect.
- Make loading of new sounds/music on a new thread, so it doesn't lag on the game.
- window.Attach() and deatach() uses a list of KX_GameObeject(GUI) or Widgets that will be
moved/scaled/rotated when you swich a GUI camera.

BEHAVIOR
- Rewrite the camera and control behaviors and add beheavior properties to the documentation. Ex: behavior.scene (read-only), self.gui (GUI Behavior).
- Make an animator (class, not behavior, used by control behavior).
	NOTE:
	Skyrim Behavior contains 3 classes/behaviors: Animator, InputControl, CameraView.
	GTA ````
	AssasinsCreed ````
- Make update() wait until all LibLoad on the initialization is complete.

DYNAMIC
- Add core.dynamic.remove("file.blend") or core.dynamic.remove("libname")
# - Add KX_GameObject = core.dynamic.copy(KX_GameObject) -> Use ObjectGenerator instead.
- Make lebel editor
# - Thread the loading of the file in memory with the "data" option of LibLoad and async. -> Not nesscesary, probably overkill.

LAUNCHER
- Test MacOS version.
- Somewhat BUG: If launching the same game from multiple places with no-write-permission the .blend path used is the one of the first launch. We should probably use the read-only config file for the .blend path instead. Maybe in 0.7?

GUI
- Add a LoadingBar widget.
- Make buttons with press layer (not only over)
- Make a pause system. (That works)
- Make SplitWindow system for Window.
- Fix bug with Labels scale/position on Render->Display->Scale Mode.
- Fix bug caused by BGE incompetence that doesn't update nor indicates the cursor position when it is out of the window/fullscreen on standalone mode and fucks our custom cursors.

MEDIA
- Add adjustable latterbox with transition effect.
- window.Attach() and deatach() uses a list of KX_GameObeject(GUI) or Widgets that will be
moved/scaled/rotated/reparented when you swich a GUI camera.

BEHAVIOR
- Rewrite the camera and control behaviors and add beheavior properties to the documentation. Ex: behavior.scene (read-only), self.gui (GUI Behavior).
- Make an animator (class, not behavior, used by control behavior).
	NOTE:
	Skyrim Behavior contains 3 classes/behaviors: Animator, InputControl, CameraView.
	GTA ````
	AssasinsCreed ````
- Make update() wait until all LibLoad on the initialization is complete.

DYNAMIC
- Add core.dynamic.remove("file.blend") or core.dynamic.remove("libname")

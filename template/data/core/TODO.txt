LAUNCHER
- Compile Linux version & edit to work with installed blender in Debian and derivated systems.

GUI
- Replace font objects with blf.
	It's compatibe with object color (including alpha).
	You can get the text dimensions, it means corrected alignation.
	No pexelation.
	The deep of the plane can be adjusted on blf.position.z, it works fine but
	its value != object.position.z, instead a transformation to camera coords is needed,
	it may requiere further investigation to found the proper value.	

- Add a LoadingBar widget.
- Make buttons with press layer (not only over)
- Make default start game menu.
- Make a pause system.
- Make SplitWindow system for Window.

MEDIA
- Add SoundEffect class (3D short sound, remaining in RAM, deleted when setScene)
- Add adjustable latterbox with transition effect.
- Add backgroundColor and make fadeIn work with this color and fadeOut with it's inverse.
- window.Attach() and deatach() uses a list of KX_GameObeject(GUI) or Widgets that will be
moved/scaled/rotated when you swich a GUI camera.

UTILS
- Check overall.

BEHAVIOR
- Rewrite the camera and control behaviors and add beheavior properties to the documentation. Ex: behavior.scene (read-only), self.gui (GUI Behavior).
- Make an animator (class, not behavior, used by control behavior).
	NOTE:
	Skyrim Behavior contains 3 classes/behaviors: Animator, InputControl, CameraView.
	GTA ````
	AssasinsCreed ````
- Make update() wait until all LibLoad on the initialization are complete.

DYNAMIC
- Put LibLoad api here. So: core.dynamic.load("file.blend")
- Better usage of self.objects.
- Add core.dynamic.remove("file.blend")
- Add KX_GameObject = core.dynamic.copy(KX_GameObject)
- LOD will be here too.

IMPORTANT
- Change main loop system, scene behaviors and their object behaviors should be executed on
a controller of that scene, not the GUI. Otherwise a lot of BGE API breaks.

LAUNCHER
- Compile Mac version

GUI
- Add a LoadingBar widget.
- Make buttons with press layer (not only over)
- Make a pause system.
- Make SplitWindow system for Window.
- Fix bug with Labels scale/position on Render->Display->Scale Mode.
- Fix bug with Labels \n and \t characters.

MEDIA
- Add adjustable latterbox with transition effect.
- Add backgroundColor and make fadeIn work with this color and fadeOut with it's inverse.
- window.Attach() and deatach() uses a list of KX_GameObeject(GUI) or Widgets that will be
moved/scaled/rotated when you swich a GUI camera.

BEHAVIOR
- Rewrite the camera and control behaviors and add beheavior properties to the documentation. Ex: behavior.scene (read-only), self.gui (GUI Behavior).
- Make an animator (class, not behavior, used by control behavior).
	NOTE:
	Skyrim Behavior contains 3 classes/behaviors: Animator, InputControl, CameraView.
	GTA ````
	AssasinsCreed ````
- Make update() wait until all LibLoad on the initialization is complete.

DYNAMIC
- Add core.dynamic.remove("file.blend") or core.dynamic.remove("libname")
# - Add KX_GameObject = core.dynamic.copy(KX_GameObject) -> Use ObjectGenerator instead.
- Make lebel editor
# - Thread the loading of the file in memory with the "data" option of LibLoad and async. -> Not nesscesary, probably overkill.

1
00:00:01,180 --> 00:00:02,684
<i>In other news, Chuckie Sol,
a made man in the Black Mask mob</i>

2
00:00:02,784 --> 00:00:03,422
<i>was kidnapped at gunpoint
by masked assailants earlier today.</i>

3
00:00:03,522 --> 00:00:04,292
<i>Suspicion is high that Sol was a victim</i>

4
00:00:04,392 --> 00:00:05,661
<i>raging between the mob
and a new rival gang</i>

5
00:00:06,761 --> 00:00:07,896
<i>composed of high-tech criminals
known to have crossed paths with Batman.</i>

6
00:00:07,399 --> 00:00:08,444
I don't know about any weapon shipment,
Tusk. Mask don't tell us...
And so and so and so...

7
00:00:09,804 --> 00:00:10,405
You could do better than that, Chuckie.
We ain't got all night.

8
00:00:10,477 --> 00:00:11,178
Old Electrocutioner here gets
mighty ticked when someone lies.
LOLOLO
LOLOLO

9
00:00:11,616 --> 00:00:12,013
When is that weapons shipment due?

10
00:01:11,971 --> 00:01:15,009
Wait... Batman doesn't use guns.

11
00:01:15,409 --> 00:01:17,544
Batman doesn't.

12
00:01:17,644 --> 00:01:19,458
But I do.

13
00:01:31,191 --> 00:01:34,520
- I'm just the accountant.
- Shut it!

14
00:01:57,083 --> 00:01:59,578
That's no way to treat a lady.

15
00:02:13,867 --> 00:02:16,737
I could've handled these C-listers
on my own.

16
00:02:16,837 --> 00:02:21,378
Dressing like a bat doesn't make you
a hero. It just makes you a target.

17
00:02:23,043 --> 00:02:25,761
And using a gun makes you just like them.

18
00:02:31,050 --> 00:02:34,269
I want you out of here. Now!

19
00:03:30,409 --> 00:03:32,194
Down!

20
00:03:41,086 --> 00:03:44,224
This wasn't a break-in. Was it, Firefly?

21
00:03:44,324 --> 00:03:45,712
Of course not.

22
00:03:45,812 --> 00:03:49,377
- They're working for someone new.
- Who?

23
00:03:52,164 --> 00:03:57,187
This is truly an honor, Batman.
I've waited so very long for this moment.

24
00:03:57,287 --> 00:04:00,972
Though the circumstances
are less than ideal.

25
00:04:01,090 --> 00:04:02,804
Do I know you?

26
00:04:02,904 --> 00:04:06,776
Intimately... and not at all.

27
00:04:10,399 --> 00:04:13,205
And you rag on me for stealing your look.

28
00:04:36,993 --> 00:04:38,932
Onyx, now.

29
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:42,031
Rest well, Batman.

30
00:05:59,276 --> 00:06:02,166
<i>It's not like he punches a time clock,
but I can assure you</i>

31
00:06:02,266 --> 00:06:06,817
<i>that the Gotham Police Force is more
than capable of keeping this city safe.</i>

32
00:06:06,917 --> 00:06:10,001
<i>Even without a masked hero to back us up.</i>

33
00:06:12,588 --> 00:06:15,086
You're a bad liar, Gordon.

34
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:32,576
- <i>So, are on your way?</i>
- Yeah, babe. You can't believe the traffic.

35
00:06:33,626 --> 00:06:35,510
It's Blockbuster!

36
00:06:43,476 --> 00:06:47,500
<i>Can't wait to see you.
It's been weeks, Dick.</i>

37
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:50,060
<i>I've almost forgotten what you feel like.</i>

38
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:52,243
I'll remind...

39
00:06:55,137 --> 00:06:59,283
- <i>It's... What's all that noise?</i>
- Construction.

40
00:07:01,170 --> 00:07:03,990
Hold on, I think I see an opening.

41
00:07:09,979 --> 00:07:14,599
Yup. All clear, Kori.
I'll be at the tower in fi...

42
00:07:15,919 --> 00:07:18,955
Babe, you have no idea
how sorry I am, but...

43
00:07:19,055 --> 00:07:23,760
- <i>But, what about our...</i>
- Got a family emergency. Nightwing out.

44
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:27,078
Your timing really sucks, Alfred.

45
00:07:38,423 --> 00:07:42,362
Well, your trip to the rainforest
seems ill-timed, Mr. Wayne.

46
00:07:42,562 --> 00:07:46,583
- With the world tech summit coming up...
- <i>It's not for another week, Ms. Bannister.</i>

47
00:07:46,983 --> 00:07:48,551
<i>We're down here studying rare herbs</i>

48
00:07:48,651 --> 00:07:51,187
<i>that could prove revolutionary
for medical research.</i>

49
00:07:51,287 --> 00:07:54,491
And earn millions
for our pharmaceutical interests.

50
00:07:54,591 --> 00:07:58,995
All well and good. But why did you
have to lead the team?

51
00:07:59,195 --> 00:08:00,830
<i>Because it's my company.</i>

52
00:08:00,930 --> 00:08:03,483
<i>And I can do whatever
the bloody hell I want to.</i>

53
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:07,337
<i>You still have to answer to this board,
Mr. Wayne. And frankly...</i>

54
00:08:07,437 --> 00:08:09,105
I think we're done here.

55
00:08:09,205 --> 00:08:12,976
If any of you have further concerns,
bring them to Lucius.

56
00:08:13,076 --> 00:08:16,961
He's more than capable
of handling things while I'm gone.

57
00:08:21,985 --> 00:08:23,720
Oh, dear.

58
00:08:23,820 --> 00:08:26,756
I'd watch those "bloody hells," governor.

59
00:08:26,856 --> 00:08:28,391
Don't want to be giving yourself away.

60
00:08:28,491 --> 00:08:33,396
Master Dick. It's bad manners
to sneak up on a person like that.

61
00:08:33,496 --> 00:08:37,214
Sneaking up on people is kind
of what we do around here, Alfred.

62
00:08:37,733 --> 00:08:39,735
That's a joke.

63
00:08:39,835 --> 00:08:43,123
We are not amused.

64
00:08:43,223 --> 00:08:46,574
I'm not exactly in a festive mood either.

65
00:08:47,843 --> 00:08:52,898
- How long has he been gone?
- Two weeks, one day, 15 hours.

66
00:08:53,766 --> 00:08:55,101
Wouldn't be the first time.

67
00:08:55,451 --> 00:09:00,356
But he's never been gone this long
without notifying me in some way.

68
00:09:00,456 --> 00:09:04,627
Last night, the signal was up for an hour.
Third time this week.

69
00:09:04,727 --> 00:09:07,247
And if the police are aware
of his absence,

70
00:09:07,347 --> 00:09:10,850
then you can be certain
the criminal class is as well.

71
00:09:10,950 --> 00:09:15,105
There's already been a sharp uptick
in underworld activities.

72
00:09:15,205 --> 00:09:17,490
If Batman doesn't return soon...

73
00:09:17,590 --> 00:09:21,007
I know. All bloody hell's
gonna break loose.

74
00:09:22,511 --> 00:09:26,307
Even when you've disappeared,
I can't get away from you.

75
00:09:29,084 --> 00:09:32,422
Oh, Mr. Fox.
I think it's way past time we...

76
00:09:32,522 --> 00:09:37,942
Apologies, Ms. Bannister. I have
an important visitor who simply can't wait.

77
00:09:42,588 --> 00:09:44,868
- That woman!
- What's wrong, Dad?

78
00:09:44,968 --> 00:09:49,205
Bannister's been barking at you for years.
You never let her get under your skin.

79
00:09:49,305 --> 00:09:51,608
Maybe I'm getting too old for this.

80
00:09:51,708 --> 00:09:54,077
Come on. Let's get some grub.

81
00:09:54,577 --> 00:09:59,282
I'm afraid I'm gonna have to cancel, Luke.
Too much on my plate right here.

82
00:09:59,382 --> 00:10:01,906
Of course, if you'd finally
accept Mr. Wayne's offer,

83
00:10:02,006 --> 00:10:04,354
- we could do lunch every day.
- Dad...

84
00:10:04,454 --> 00:10:06,589
With your background
in physics and math...

85
00:10:06,689 --> 00:10:08,992
- Dad...
- ...you'd be an extraordinary asset.

86
00:10:09,092 --> 00:10:14,330
Dad! I said no before I went
into the service and it's still no.

87
00:10:14,430 --> 00:10:15,232
Why?

88
00:10:15,332 --> 00:10:18,149
You're the one who told me
to follow my own path.

89
00:10:20,736 --> 00:10:25,823
Yes. But I never thought
it would take you to Afghanistan.

90
00:10:41,923 --> 00:10:44,582
I thought your doctor
told you to give that up.

91
00:10:49,364 --> 00:10:53,069
I've decided to live dangerously.
Like my daughter.

92
00:10:53,169 --> 00:10:57,173
As I recall, I picked up the art
of dangerous living from you, Colonel Kane.

93
00:10:57,273 --> 00:10:58,341
How are you, Dad?

94
00:10:58,441 --> 00:11:02,562
I'm more concerned with how you are,
Kate. I haven't seen you in weeks.

95
00:11:02,662 --> 00:11:05,957
I was hoping you'd met some nice girl.

96
00:11:06,983 --> 00:11:11,253
I've been trying to find out something,
anything, about my mystery man.

97
00:11:11,353 --> 00:11:14,344
- And?
- It's like he doesn't even exist.

98
00:11:14,444 --> 00:11:18,912
- What about his friends?
- Vanished without a trace.

99
00:11:19,012 --> 00:11:22,665
I watched that place blow apart, Dad.
There was no way he could've escaped.

100
00:11:22,765 --> 00:11:25,435
And I keep wondering
if there was something...

101
00:11:25,535 --> 00:11:27,891
Anything that I could've done.

102
00:11:27,991 --> 00:11:32,058
Are you sure he's dead, Kate?
This is Batman we're talking about.

103
00:11:32,408 --> 00:11:35,094
No one could've survived that.

104
00:11:35,194 --> 00:11:37,879
I need your help on this one.

105
00:11:41,416 --> 00:11:44,054
Your mother always thought
you'd be an artist.

106
00:11:44,154 --> 00:11:47,345
Elizabeth was the one
with the real talent.

107
00:11:55,731 --> 00:11:58,949
Katey. Are you okay?

108
00:12:01,370 --> 00:12:03,221
Kate?

109
00:12:04,874 --> 00:12:08,359
I'll see what my network can dig up
on your mystery man.

110
00:12:09,811 --> 00:12:12,949
They keep hoping
for an answer, don't they?

111
00:12:13,049 --> 00:12:16,467
- Why don't you give them one.
- Not my style.

112
00:12:26,895 --> 00:12:30,247
It seems reports of his death
have been greatly...

113
00:12:32,234 --> 00:12:34,318
exaggerated.

114
00:12:36,455 --> 00:12:38,739
Watch your back, Kate.

115
00:12:48,283 --> 00:12:50,420
New guy thinks he can move in.

116
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:53,990
I'm gonna show those punks
who's top dog around here.

117
00:12:54,090 --> 00:12:58,161
- Gotham's my bitch.
- Which makes you mine, Mask.

118
00:12:58,261 --> 00:13:01,950
You're supposed to be dead.
Let me fix that for you.

119
00:13:21,216 --> 00:13:22,934
Damn it!

120
00:13:27,088 --> 00:13:30,841
I bet 50 grand that you
were dead this time.

121
00:13:31,527 --> 00:13:33,664
You lost.

122
00:13:33,764 --> 00:13:36,113
Always bet on Black.

123
00:13:49,478 --> 00:13:53,497
Robin? Somebody kill this freaking kid!

124
00:14:05,211 --> 00:14:06,661
Damian?

125
00:14:51,473 --> 00:14:54,744
- What?
- I could've handled this alone.

126
00:14:54,944 --> 00:14:59,416
If that's your best, Batman,
you're not gonna fool anyone, Grayson.

127
00:15:00,316 --> 00:15:03,634
Maybe you'd like a megaphone
to announce that?

128
00:15:11,627 --> 00:15:13,964
There's no way you're gonna
pull this off without my help.

129
00:15:14,464 --> 00:15:15,632
Modest as ever, I see.

130
00:15:15,732 --> 00:15:19,331
I'm more Batman than you'll ever be.
Just follow my lead.

131
00:15:21,870 --> 00:15:23,988
We're being tailed.

132
00:15:52,367 --> 00:15:55,050
You've been tracking me all night.

133
00:15:55,150 --> 00:15:57,473
I want to know why.

134
00:15:57,573 --> 00:16:01,177
First, tell me why you're running
around Gotham playing dress-up.

135
00:16:01,277 --> 00:16:03,227
I'm guessing Nightwing?

136
00:16:05,313 --> 00:16:06,282
Busted.

137
00:16:06,382 --> 00:16:09,585
Actually, I think he's more than capable
of fooling most people.

138
00:16:09,685 --> 00:16:12,507
And you're certainly not gonna
pass for Batman, short stack.

139
00:16:12,955 --> 00:16:15,925
- Who the hell are you?
- Easy, Robin.

140
00:16:16,025 --> 00:16:18,461
Tell me what you want
and why you've been following me.

141
00:16:18,561 --> 00:16:22,527
I just had to make sure. You see,
I was there the night Batman died.

142
00:16:27,168 --> 00:16:29,338
He threw me clear and saved my life.

143
00:16:29,438 --> 00:16:33,390
But before I could get
back up here it blew apart.

144
00:16:34,709 --> 00:16:37,780
- And we're just supposed to believe that?
- Believe what you want.

145
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:41,899
- I don't trust her.
- Oh, but you did trust Talon.

146
00:16:42,217 --> 00:16:43,583
Shut up.

147
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:47,123
Who was it? Who were Tusk
and Firefly working for?

148
00:16:47,223 --> 00:16:51,694
I don't know. But when I find out,
I'll drop a note in your lunchbox.

149
00:16:51,794 --> 00:16:54,998
If you're serious about hunting them down
then we should work together.

150
00:16:55,298 --> 00:16:59,280
Just because I wear this,
doesn't mean I'm a part of your little cult.

151
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:08,492
You really have a way with women, Grayson.

152
00:17:15,784 --> 00:17:18,303
Do you think he's really dead?

153
00:17:18,403 --> 00:17:19,605
I don't know.

154
00:17:19,705 --> 00:17:22,792
You'd like it, wouldn't you...
if he never came back?

155
00:17:22,892 --> 00:17:25,442
Then you get to keep that suit.

156
00:17:31,666 --> 00:17:34,370
I've struggled for years
to get out of Bruce's shadow,

157
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:38,157
to build a life for myself as far away
from his world as possible.

158
00:17:38,257 --> 00:17:42,160
And the last thing I want
is to be wearing this damn thing!

159
00:17:44,948 --> 00:17:49,005
<i>I've finally managed to locate
Master Bruce's files on Batwoman.</i>

160
00:17:49,105 --> 00:17:50,520
How come I never heard of her?

161
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:55,706
- <i>She's kept a rather low profile.</i>
- Not low enough for Batman, I'll bet.

162
00:17:57,225 --> 00:18:01,196
<i>Investigative report on Batwoman,
aka Katherine Kane.</i>

163
00:18:01,296 --> 00:18:03,733
- Katey?
- You know her?

164
00:18:04,133 --> 00:18:07,471
<i>Her father is Colonel Jacob Kane.
Military intelligence.</i>

165
00:18:07,871 --> 00:18:12,241
<i>On Katherine's 12th birthday, she and
her twin sister Elizabeth were abducted,</i>

166
00:18:12,341 --> 00:18:15,995
<i>along with their mother, Gabrielle,
and held for ransom.</i>

167
00:18:16,095 --> 00:18:19,515
<i>Colonel Kane led a rescue mission
that saved Kate's life.</i>

168
00:18:19,615 --> 00:18:23,783
<i>But in the attempt both Gabrielle
and Elizabeth were murdered.</i>

169
00:18:23,883 --> 00:18:26,990
<i>She would follow in her father's footsteps,
enrolling at West Point,</i>

170
00:18:27,390 --> 00:18:31,344
<i>but ultimately expelled.
Something broke inside Kate.</i>

171
00:18:31,444 --> 00:18:34,497
<i>Two years later,
Katherine emerged as Batwoman.</i>

172
00:18:34,597 --> 00:18:38,401
<i>She's impressive, but her methods
make her a danger to this city.</i>

173
00:18:38,501 --> 00:18:39,869
<i>And to herself.</i>

174
00:18:39,969 --> 00:18:43,182
<i>It's time for me to decide if I'm going
to take her under my wing...</i>

175
00:18:45,307 --> 00:18:47,652
<i>or take her down.</i>

176
00:18:49,745 --> 00:18:53,403
Poor Katey. It always begins
with death. Doesn't it, Alfred?

177
00:18:53,683 --> 00:18:56,752
<i>I'm as astonished as you are, Master Dick.</i>

178
00:18:56,852 --> 00:19:00,372
Anyone mind filling me in?
How do you know her?

179
00:19:00,472 --> 00:19:02,103
I just do.

180
00:19:14,569 --> 00:19:16,672
I had to dig very deep, my dear,

181
00:19:16,772 --> 00:19:20,309
reach out to contacts
that even I find somewhat unsavory.

182
00:19:20,409 --> 00:19:23,346
But here he is, your mystery man.

183
00:19:23,446 --> 00:19:27,450
The Heretic. That's his accomplice. Onyx.

184
00:19:27,550 --> 00:19:30,186
Heretic? What kind of name is that?

185
00:19:30,286 --> 00:19:34,497
One that invokes disbelief.
His accomplishments certainly do.

186
00:19:34,957 --> 00:19:39,228
In the last 10 months, he has quietly
forged some dangerous alliances,

187
00:19:39,328 --> 00:19:42,064
as well as become a Thorn
in the side of Black Mask.

188
00:19:42,164 --> 00:19:45,585
He may have gathered half the criminals
in Gotham under his command.

189
00:19:45,685 --> 00:19:47,810
- But who is he?
- All I know is...

190
00:19:47,910 --> 00:19:52,274
that he's left a trail of empty vaults
and dead bodies across this city.

191
00:19:52,374 --> 00:19:57,279
And as your experience attests,
he seems to have a fixation with Batman.

192
00:19:57,379 --> 00:20:00,316
With all due respect, Dad,
that doesn't help much.

193
00:20:00,416 --> 00:20:04,629
I'm sorry. I just need
to figure this out on my own.

194
00:20:05,537 --> 00:20:08,083
I'll see you back at the house.

195
00:20:09,407 --> 00:20:13,222
Don't worry, Kate.
I won't let you down again.

196
00:20:23,938 --> 00:20:27,610
If you're gonna keep standing me up
for dinner, Dad, you could at least call.

197
00:20:27,710 --> 00:20:31,823
Oh, God. Luke, I'm sorry.
I'm just swamped.

198
00:20:35,984 --> 00:20:38,596
It's not just the summit, is it?

199
00:20:39,020 --> 00:20:40,023
Excuse me?

200
00:20:40,123 --> 00:20:42,874
This has something to do
with the fact that Batman's missing.

201
00:20:42,974 --> 00:20:44,540
Batman?

202
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:48,007
Dad, you've been bringing me here
since I was a kid.

203
00:20:48,107 --> 00:20:49,936
I've seen enough over the years
to figure out

204
00:20:50,036 --> 00:20:53,089
that there's some connection between
Wayne Enterprises and Batman.

205
00:20:53,189 --> 00:20:56,005
Somehow I missed that
in the last stockholder's report.

206
00:20:56,105 --> 00:20:59,408
In fact, if I was gonna make
an educated guess,

207
00:20:59,508 --> 00:21:01,744
I'd say you supply him
with some of his tech.

208
00:21:01,844 --> 00:21:05,224
- That's some theory.
- Dad, I just...

209
00:21:29,004 --> 00:21:32,365
It's coming from Wayne Tech. The vault.

210
00:21:39,732 --> 00:21:42,417
Don't play games with me.

211
00:21:42,517 --> 00:21:45,530
I don't know about any vault.

212
00:21:46,121 --> 00:21:48,695
Fine. Kill him.

213
00:22:02,203 --> 00:22:07,906
Get us into the vault, Mr. Fox,
or your son becomes a memory.

214
00:22:08,911 --> 00:22:10,722
Stop!

215
00:22:36,837 --> 00:22:39,875
Look at all these magnificent toys.

216
00:22:40,075 --> 00:22:41,811
You know what we need, Kuttler.

217
00:22:41,911 --> 00:22:45,364
Yes. A fleet of trucks,
so we can take it all.

218
00:22:45,464 --> 00:22:49,511
But for now...
the components will have to do.

219
00:23:04,232 --> 00:23:06,101
How could you know?

220
00:23:06,201 --> 00:23:09,104
This is the 21st century, Mr. Fox.

221
00:23:09,204 --> 00:23:13,318
There are no secrets
in this world anymore.

222
00:23:14,542 --> 00:23:16,355
Dad!

223
00:23:18,212 --> 00:23:21,626
Except the ones we take to our graves.

224
00:23:55,716 --> 00:23:59,298
You dare to wear the mantle of the bat.

225
00:24:21,175 --> 00:24:23,788
Get to the transport.

226
00:24:28,616 --> 00:24:30,629
The boy.

227
00:24:33,589 --> 00:24:35,925
Electrocutioner, stop!

228
00:24:36,025 --> 00:24:40,138
You're gonna fry up real good,
you stupid little...

229
00:24:44,665 --> 00:24:47,172
Come back and fight, you cowards!

230
00:24:58,546 --> 00:25:01,593
- Damn it.
- Help!

231
00:25:01,783 --> 00:25:03,328
He needs an ambulance.

232
00:25:11,694 --> 00:25:14,372
You want more, Bruce?

233
00:25:14,729 --> 00:25:17,036
Don't take it all for yourself.

234
00:25:17,136 --> 00:25:21,130
Don't worry, ladies.
There's plenty of me to go around.

235
00:25:21,803 --> 00:25:24,005
Mother's pearls?

236
00:25:24,105 --> 00:25:26,517
Where did you get those?

237
00:25:27,509 --> 00:25:29,788
Where did you get them?

238
00:25:36,385 --> 00:25:38,797
What the hell is this?

239
00:26:47,923 --> 00:26:50,458
Still no progress, Tetch?

240
00:26:50,558 --> 00:26:54,329
So much memory. So much experience.

241
00:26:54,429 --> 00:26:57,799
It's a delicate job,
threading my way through the layers.

242
00:26:57,899 --> 00:27:01,470
You, on the other hand,
could be reprogrammed in an hour.

243
00:27:01,570 --> 00:27:05,006
You're like wet sand,
compared to this concrete.

244
00:27:05,106 --> 00:27:07,609
His trauma runs so deep.

245
00:27:07,709 --> 00:27:10,679
It's as if he defines himself by his pain.

246
00:27:11,079 --> 00:27:13,158
Such madness.

247
00:27:13,348 --> 00:27:15,793
You have to dig deeper.

248
00:27:17,168 --> 00:27:19,014
Push past the trauma.

249
00:27:21,924 --> 00:27:26,861
To the child he was,
before he lost his precious parents.

250
00:27:26,961 --> 00:27:29,507
Then, you'll break him.

251
00:27:33,601 --> 00:27:35,587
And then, he'll be ours.

252
00:27:35,687 --> 00:27:38,774
You make it sound so easy, Talia.

253
00:27:38,874 --> 00:27:41,910
Easier than dying, Mr. Tetch.

254
00:27:42,311 --> 00:27:46,715
We had the detonators.
But the bat was there, waiting for us.

255
00:27:46,815 --> 00:27:49,617
- Grayson.
- Not just him.

256
00:27:49,717 --> 00:27:51,620
- The boy.
- Of course.

257
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:54,456
He was nearly killed, but I saved him.

258
00:27:54,556 --> 00:27:58,027
- I saved him.
- I would expect no less.

259
00:27:58,127 --> 00:28:01,106
We should capture Damian. Bring him here.

260
00:28:03,864 --> 00:28:06,836
I prefer to keep my son
at arm's length. For now.

261
00:28:07,136 --> 00:28:09,802
But if we remove him
from the battle till it's over, then...

262
00:28:09,902 --> 00:28:12,383
I've told you, no.

263
00:28:14,175 --> 00:28:16,778
I know why you want the boy, Heretic.

264
00:28:16,878 --> 00:28:19,979
I'd stay away from that rabbit hole,
if I were you.

265
00:28:20,249 --> 00:28:23,127
Mind your own business, Tetch.

266
00:28:24,885 --> 00:28:28,356
Nothing would give me more pleasure.

267
00:28:40,334 --> 00:28:44,273
- I'm so sorry, Luke.
- That's all you have to say?

268
00:28:44,373 --> 00:28:47,042
I was in the vault, Dick. I know.

269
00:28:47,142 --> 00:28:50,521
Listen, I don't think this is the time.

270
00:28:51,279 --> 00:28:54,975
My dad might feel differently,
if he could talk.

271
00:28:58,219 --> 00:29:01,857
I came home from one war,
only to walk right into another one.

272
00:29:01,957 --> 00:29:04,568
And I want to be a part of it.

273
00:29:05,025 --> 00:29:07,579
Best way to help is right here,
at your father's side.

274
00:29:07,679 --> 00:29:09,999
I'm a soldier, Dick.
I need to be on the front lines,

275
00:29:10,099 --> 00:29:13,068
not stuck in some lab or boardroom
or freakin' bedside chair.

276
00:29:13,168 --> 00:29:16,004
And last night, I saw the weapons
that could help me.

277
00:29:16,104 --> 00:29:19,474
Weapons that my dad created
and almost got killed for.

278
00:29:19,874 --> 00:29:24,312
No, Luke, listen. I understand,
I really do, but it's not my call.

279
00:29:24,412 --> 00:29:28,592
Not right now. Things are complicated.
Trust me, okay?

280
00:29:30,985 --> 00:29:33,497
- Dick...
- Alfred.

281
00:29:34,288 --> 00:29:35,724
I'm on it.

282
00:29:35,824 --> 00:29:38,970
I got to run. I'm sorry.

283
00:29:53,041 --> 00:29:55,411
God, I haven't laughed
like that in so long.

284
00:29:55,711 --> 00:29:58,580
I noticed you looked pretty miserable
when you came in.

285
00:29:58,680 --> 00:30:00,696
One of those days?

286
00:30:01,215 --> 00:30:03,656
One of those lives.

287
00:30:04,052 --> 00:30:06,725
- Hey!
- Excuse me.

288
00:30:07,655 --> 00:30:10,591
So, you're a cop?

289
00:30:10,691 --> 00:30:12,727
A detective.

290
00:30:13,127 --> 00:30:14,730
You have a problem with that?

291
00:30:15,030 --> 00:30:17,632
No, not at all.

292
00:30:17,732 --> 00:30:21,106
You just don't look the part.

293
00:30:21,303 --> 00:30:25,907
- What's a cop supposed to look like?
- Not as hot as you.

294
00:30:26,365 --> 00:30:30,973
- Did I just say that out loud?
- Yeah, you did. You're good.

295
00:30:31,213 --> 00:30:35,289
Actually, I'm terrible.
I haven't dated in over a year and I...

296
00:30:41,705 --> 00:30:44,988
- Is something wrong?
- What? No. No. No.

297
00:30:45,088 --> 00:30:50,173
Look, I do have to go, but...
can I give you my card? Call me?

298
00:30:51,165 --> 00:30:52,467
Yeah, right.

299
00:30:52,567 --> 00:30:57,888
That's not a line, Rene, I...
I like you, I really do.

300
00:30:57,988 --> 00:31:00,529
But something's come up.

301
00:31:12,803 --> 00:31:14,444
Where's the kid?

302
00:31:17,024 --> 00:31:19,811
I thought we could talk alone... Katey.

303
00:31:21,195 --> 00:31:23,098
How long have you known?

304
00:31:23,198 --> 00:31:27,660
Me? Not long. But Batman's
been on to you from the start.

305
00:31:29,570 --> 00:31:34,609
Look, just so you know, I haven't given up.
I just... needed to clear my head.

306
00:31:34,709 --> 00:31:37,783
We all need to take off
the mask sometimes.

307
00:31:39,980 --> 00:31:42,384
To remind ourselves
that we're people underneath.

308
00:31:42,484 --> 00:31:44,553
Dick Grayson.

309
00:31:44,953 --> 00:31:48,924
You know, when we were kids and I'd
see you at all those society bashes...

310
00:31:49,024 --> 00:31:50,359
I had quite a crush on you.

311
00:31:50,459 --> 00:31:53,199
Really? I thought
you were totally annoying.

312
00:31:54,995 --> 00:31:58,096
Took me a while to get a hang
of the girl thing.

313
00:31:58,196 --> 00:32:00,735
Yeah, me too.

314
00:32:00,835 --> 00:32:05,528
- Why reveal yourself?
- Call it a hunch. Come on.

315
00:32:07,309 --> 00:32:09,544
I don't have a concussion.

316
00:32:09,644 --> 00:32:12,434
I wasn't aware you received
a medical degree

317
00:32:12,534 --> 00:32:14,970
while you were in the Himalayas,
Master Damian.

318
00:32:15,070 --> 00:32:18,387
I've been hurt worse than this
sparring with my grandfather.

319
00:32:18,487 --> 00:32:20,922
I'd hardly hold Ra's Al Ghul up

320
00:32:21,022 --> 00:32:24,326
as an example of enlightened
child-rearing.

321
00:32:24,426 --> 00:32:26,995
Master Dick was quite explicit.

322
00:32:27,095 --> 00:32:30,599
At least 24 hours of observation.

323
00:32:30,699 --> 00:32:33,802
He's not my father! And neither are you.

324
00:32:34,102 --> 00:32:38,978
And for that, young man,
you should be profoundly grateful.

325
00:32:48,082 --> 00:32:51,252
He saved my life once before, you know.

326
00:32:51,352 --> 00:32:54,343
In a way, he created me.

327
00:32:54,443 --> 00:32:56,945
Yeah, he does that.

328
00:32:57,045 --> 00:32:58,880
He pissed me off.

329
00:32:58,980 --> 00:33:01,420
He does that, too.

330
00:33:03,450 --> 00:33:06,839
<i>When I got kicked out of the military,
my life was a blur of sex,</i>

331
00:33:06,939 --> 00:33:09,941
<i>drugs and techno-house.</i>

332
00:33:10,041 --> 00:33:13,055
<i>But I thought I could take care of myself.</i>

333
00:33:16,764 --> 00:33:19,768
- How ya doin', gorgeous?
- Out of my way, asshole.

334
00:33:19,868 --> 00:33:22,074
I don't think so.

335
00:33:24,706 --> 00:33:26,957
You little bitch!

336
00:33:50,147 --> 00:33:52,007
You're welcome.

337
00:34:00,974 --> 00:34:05,847
After that night, I swore I'd never need
Batman or anyone saving me again.

338
00:34:05,947 --> 00:34:10,716
My mother and sister were victims
of the animals out there. Not me.

339
00:34:10,816 --> 00:34:15,327
I get that, Kate. But it doesn't mean
you have to be alone.

340
00:34:39,213 --> 00:34:41,692
You made a big mistake coming here.

341
00:34:50,057 --> 00:34:54,234
I was trained to never make mistakes.
Just like you.

342
00:35:04,506 --> 00:35:09,111
Don't fight it, Damian.
I've had the flaws bred out of me.

343
00:35:09,811 --> 00:35:13,719
But you... you're just a boy.

344
00:35:16,450 --> 00:35:19,225
What was it like growing up with him?

345
00:35:21,288 --> 00:35:26,578
When I was a kid, I idolized him.
Hell... I wanted to be him.

346
00:35:26,678 --> 00:35:30,931
But the older I got, the more I realized
that I didn't know him at all.

347
00:35:31,031 --> 00:35:35,670
How could I? Bruce Wayne
is as much a mask as Batman.

348
00:35:35,770 --> 00:35:38,991
And I think the only thing
behind those masks is pain.

349
00:35:39,741 --> 00:35:42,644
A pain he refuses to share with anyone.

350
00:35:43,210 --> 00:35:45,892
So what was it like?

351
00:35:46,547 --> 00:35:48,687
Lonely.

352
00:36:41,185 --> 00:36:43,972
- It's Alfred.
- Your butler is a part of this, too?

353
00:36:44,072 --> 00:36:46,541
Trust me, he's a total badass. Yeah?

354
00:36:46,641 --> 00:36:50,025
<i>Master Damian is gone, sir.</i>

355
00:37:21,441 --> 00:37:23,018
Where am I?

356
00:37:27,548 --> 00:37:30,694
- What the hell are you doing?
- Unfortunately...

357
00:37:30,794 --> 00:37:33,847
I have no more choice in this than you do.

358
00:37:38,425 --> 00:37:40,632
Who are you?

359
00:37:44,715 --> 00:37:47,280
I'm you, Damian...

360
00:37:48,519 --> 00:37:50,539
all grown up.

361
00:37:50,639 --> 00:37:53,508
You're not me. You can't be.

362
00:37:53,608 --> 00:37:56,277
I'm the product of a program that your...

363
00:37:56,377 --> 00:37:59,447
our grandfather initiated.

364
00:37:59,547 --> 00:38:02,363
He wanted to create the perfect soldier.

365
00:38:02,633 --> 00:38:07,188
They used your DNA and put it
through a process of accelerated growth.

366
00:38:07,288 --> 00:38:09,990
Most of the prototypes died quickly.

367
00:38:10,090 --> 00:38:11,860
But I survived.

368
00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:15,296
I was the strongest of them all.

369
00:38:15,496 --> 00:38:16,731
Still...

370
00:38:16,831 --> 00:38:21,770
I was an empty shell, till Mr. Tetch here
brought me to full consciousness.

371
00:38:21,870 --> 00:38:27,638
And as good a job as he did,
there's always been something missing.

372
00:38:27,738 --> 00:38:29,410
A void.

373
00:38:29,510 --> 00:38:32,629
And I'm going to fill that void...

374
00:38:32,729 --> 00:38:34,832
with you.

375
00:38:35,082 --> 00:38:37,485
Everything in there...

376
00:38:37,585 --> 00:38:40,187
is going in here.

377
00:38:40,287 --> 00:38:42,557
You, brother...

378
00:38:42,657 --> 00:38:45,689
will provide me with a soul.

379
00:38:45,789 --> 00:38:47,885
The hell, I am.

380
00:38:52,265 --> 00:38:55,403
I don't understand why she just
doesn't grow another one of you.

381
00:38:55,503 --> 00:38:59,027
- She's got a freezer full...
- Are you insane?

382
00:39:00,908 --> 00:39:02,981
Mother.

383
00:39:09,683 --> 00:39:11,419
How dare you!

384
00:39:11,519 --> 00:39:15,223
It wasn't my idea.
This lunatic said he'd kill me if I...

385
00:39:15,323 --> 00:39:18,364
Shut up! You'll suffer for this.

386
00:39:20,127 --> 00:39:23,164
My entire life I've been suffering!

387
00:39:23,264 --> 00:39:26,885
Tell me, what is a man without memories?

388
00:39:27,235 --> 00:39:31,573
I want to know you,
and love you, as he does.

389
00:39:31,773 --> 00:39:36,148
I want to feel you in my heart.
In my blood.

390
00:39:37,577 --> 00:39:42,457
I've always served you without question.
I've never asked anything of you.

391
00:39:43,550 --> 00:39:47,804
Please, let me have this.

392
00:39:50,157 --> 00:39:52,493
You poor tormented creature,

393
00:39:52,593 --> 00:39:55,897
how could I not have felt
the depths of your pain?

394
00:39:56,397 --> 00:39:59,888
How could a mother have left
her child so alone...

395
00:40:00,300 --> 00:40:02,441
in the dark.

396
00:40:07,875 --> 00:40:09,994
How could you just kill him
like that? He was...

397
00:40:10,094 --> 00:40:11,900
He was flawed.

398
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,479
What about me, am I flawed, too?

399
00:40:14,579 --> 00:40:16,417
Remove all memories of this incident

400
00:40:16,517 --> 00:40:18,820
and then make the other
necessary adjustments.

401
00:40:18,920 --> 00:40:21,990
- Adjustments?
- You're of no use to me like this.

402
00:40:22,090 --> 00:40:24,727
Recalcitrant, emotional.

403
00:40:25,459 --> 00:40:27,729
Your father's influence, no doubt.

404
00:40:27,829 --> 00:40:30,969
Onyx, get this trash out of here.

405
00:40:34,948 --> 00:40:38,473
Good thing Alfred had the foresight
to put a tracker on the kid's uniform.

406
00:40:38,573 --> 00:40:40,842
The sisters of perpetual grace.

407
00:40:40,942 --> 00:40:43,845
A respected religious order
with missions across the world.

408
00:40:43,945 --> 00:40:46,893
Perfect front for criminal scumbags.

409
00:41:10,454 --> 00:41:12,209
This isn't gonna be easy.

410
00:41:15,208 --> 00:41:18,345
Nuns with M60s and katanas?

411
00:41:18,445 --> 00:41:21,119
That would make them nunjas.

412
00:41:40,533 --> 00:41:43,942
Kind of hate I let you talk me
into using rubber bullets.

413
00:41:58,819 --> 00:42:01,443
Looks like you could use a little help.

414
00:42:05,125 --> 00:42:07,862
- Hello, nurse.
- Luke?

415
00:42:07,962 --> 00:42:11,429
You want a megaphone to announce that?
Call me Batwing.

416
00:42:14,034 --> 00:42:17,037
Batwing? That's original.

417
00:42:18,739 --> 00:42:21,447
Can't say I'm not glad to see you.

418
00:42:45,766 --> 00:42:48,669
It's the bats. Three of them!

419
00:42:48,869 --> 00:42:50,771
Three?

420
00:42:51,171 --> 00:42:54,246
- We retreat.
- Why?

421
00:42:55,258 --> 00:42:56,911
The compound is expendable.

422
00:42:57,011 --> 00:43:01,013
We have more urgent matters
to attend to. Come.

423
00:43:15,996 --> 00:43:19,037
Kill him! Kill him!

424
00:44:07,715 --> 00:44:10,735
It's me, it's your son.

425
00:44:11,875 --> 00:44:14,426
Come on, Father.

426
00:44:22,229 --> 00:44:25,770
Batman, we need you.

427
00:44:43,817 --> 00:44:46,257
Can you blow those doors?

428
00:44:47,420 --> 00:44:52,130
- God's not going to like this.
- I don't think she's been here for a while.

429
00:45:14,015 --> 00:45:16,224
This way!

430
00:45:45,879 --> 00:45:48,286
Come on, Father.

431
00:45:52,953 --> 00:45:54,129
How are you?

432
00:45:54,229 --> 00:45:58,263
In one piece, which is more
than I can say for this place.

433
00:47:19,199 --> 00:47:20,797
No.

434
00:47:36,690 --> 00:47:39,026
Thanks for saving our butts
back there, Luke.

435
00:47:39,126 --> 00:47:41,762
Yeah, too bad they got away.

436
00:47:41,862 --> 00:47:45,399
Well, Dad always wanted me
to work with Bruce Wayne.

437
00:47:45,499 --> 00:47:48,162
I'm proud to be a part of your team.

438
00:47:49,002 --> 00:47:52,005
We can handle this on our own.

439
00:47:52,105 --> 00:47:55,980
Nightwing, Robin, back to Gotham.

440
00:47:57,667 --> 00:47:59,699
You're welcome.

441
00:48:08,121 --> 00:48:11,592
You really should be resting.
The summit's tomorrow.

442
00:48:11,792 --> 00:48:14,732
It's been a week, I'm fine.

443
00:48:14,878 --> 00:48:17,714
Like father, like son.

444
00:48:18,064 --> 00:48:22,904
All things considered, Master Bruce,
you're in surprisingly good condition.

445
00:48:23,104 --> 00:48:25,906
She treated you... treated us...

446
00:48:26,006 --> 00:48:29,110
like we were machines
that she could just program.

447
00:48:29,210 --> 00:48:30,945
That's all we were to her.

448
00:48:31,045 --> 00:48:33,848
After Bruce Wayne completes
his hosting duties at the summit,

449
00:48:33,948 --> 00:48:35,733
we'll gather any leads we can to find her.

450
00:48:35,833 --> 00:48:39,136
Why wait? I'll call in Kate
and Luke and then...

451
00:48:39,236 --> 00:48:42,420
No. You shouldn't have involved them
in the first place.

452
00:48:42,520 --> 00:48:46,427
- Batwing pretty much involved himself.
- And Batwoman?

453
00:48:46,527 --> 00:48:49,567
Did she force you to reveal our secrets?

454
00:48:50,830 --> 00:48:52,566
You weren't here, sir.

455
00:48:52,666 --> 00:48:55,503
Master Dick made a judgment call,

456
00:48:55,603 --> 00:48:58,376
and I think it was the right one.

457
00:48:58,838 --> 00:49:01,509
Maybe so, but from here on...

458
00:49:01,609 --> 00:49:03,915
it's only family.

459
00:49:04,561 --> 00:49:07,228
Kate's going through the hard drive
we pulled from the convent.

460
00:49:07,328 --> 00:49:09,962
- Fine, but when she's done, that's it.
- But we have to...

461
00:49:10,062 --> 00:49:14,915
You're not Batman anymore, Dick!
I call the shots around here.

462
00:49:18,558 --> 00:49:22,296
He's been through an extraordinary
ordeal, Master Dick.

463
00:49:22,396 --> 00:49:25,740
Yeah? Well, so have we.

464
00:49:26,133 --> 00:49:28,687
<i>As the summit kicks off today,
politicians and dignitaries</i>

465
00:49:28,787 --> 00:49:30,963
<i>from more than 20 nations
converge on Gotham,</i>

466
00:49:31,063 --> 00:49:34,875
<i>for what promises to be a pivotal look
at how technology will shape our future.</i>

467
00:49:34,975 --> 00:49:38,907
<i>Minutes ago, Bruce Wayne arrived to deliver
the keynote address that will kick off</i>

468
00:49:39,007 --> 00:49:42,700
<i>the conference and also unveil
ground-breaking technological advances.</i>

469
00:49:42,800 --> 00:49:47,575
<i>Up next, researchers discover
mysterious findings on Mars...</i>

470
00:49:49,656 --> 00:49:51,797
What do you mean he doesn't want my help?

471
00:49:53,094 --> 00:49:57,831
He says he's grateful for everything
you've done, Kate, but he just feels that...

472
00:49:57,931 --> 00:50:00,371
Oh, hell, you know what he's like.

473
00:50:04,939 --> 00:50:07,635
He just wants to keep it in the family.

474
00:50:08,142 --> 00:50:10,844
I thought you wanted me
to be part of the family.

475
00:50:10,944 --> 00:50:13,481
Yeah, what do I know?

476
00:50:13,681 --> 00:50:18,323
- <i>Find anything on that hard drive, yet?</i>
- No, I gave it to Batwing.

477
00:50:18,818 --> 00:50:21,720
I figured his father's tech could help us.

478
00:50:22,755 --> 00:50:25,158
<i>I'm sorry about this, Kate.</i>

479
00:50:25,258 --> 00:50:28,259
- If it were up to me...
- Nothing to be sorry about.

480
00:50:28,359 --> 00:50:30,701
Goodbye, Dick.

481
00:50:42,275 --> 00:50:44,212
Dad!

482
00:51:18,344 --> 00:51:22,016
<i>As the co-chair of Wayne Enterprises,</i>

483
00:51:22,116 --> 00:51:26,260
<i>it is my profound privilege
to present our host.</i>

484
00:51:26,420 --> 00:51:30,007
<i>A man of fellowship, a man of kindness,</i>

485
00:51:30,107 --> 00:51:32,110
<i>a man of peace.</i>

486
00:51:32,410 --> 00:51:35,483
<i>Mr. Bruce Wayne.</i>

487
00:51:53,479 --> 00:51:56,254
Soon, we'll be through
the looking glass, gentlemen.

488
00:51:57,583 --> 00:51:59,520
<i>You're all wearing beta versions
of Wayne Tech's</i>

489
00:51:59,620 --> 00:52:01,655
<i>latest breakthrough in communications.</i>

490
00:52:01,755 --> 00:52:06,797
<i>With these translators, we hope to build
bridges between language and culture.</i>

491
00:52:10,607 --> 00:52:13,534
What? We're about to take over the world.

492
00:52:13,634 --> 00:52:16,436
Can't a man dress for the occasion?

493
00:52:16,536 --> 00:52:18,510
Idiot!

494
00:52:20,006 --> 00:52:21,425
Walrus.

495
00:52:21,525 --> 00:52:23,544
<i>The world has become
a more dangerous place.</i>

496
00:52:23,644 --> 00:52:25,760
<i>To meet these threats,
Wayne Tech and S.T.A.R. Labs</i>

497
00:52:25,860 --> 00:52:27,655
<i>have developed the watchtower initiative.</i>

498
00:52:28,015 --> 00:52:31,660
<i>Prepare to embark
on the greatest adventure.</i>

499
00:53:32,611 --> 00:53:36,683
Dad doesn't even remember doing it.
He was programmed.

500
00:53:36,783 --> 00:53:40,087
- But why?
- Somehow, they knew I had that drive.

501
00:53:40,187 --> 00:53:43,691
Like they knew about the vault
at Wayne Enterprises.

502
00:53:43,791 --> 00:53:46,026
- Bruce told them.
- Not my father.

503
00:53:46,126 --> 00:53:49,374
Talia had him in there for weeks
and he suddenly snaps out of it

504
00:53:49,474 --> 00:53:51,432
just because we show up?

505
00:53:51,532 --> 00:53:54,268
No, you're wrong. He's fine.

506
00:53:54,368 --> 00:53:58,104
No, he's not. He's not fine.

507
00:53:58,204 --> 00:54:00,340
She got to him.

508
00:54:00,440 --> 00:54:03,815
- She's not finished, is she?
- She's just getting started.

509
00:54:06,646 --> 00:54:09,420
Found this on the hard drive.

510
00:54:10,016 --> 00:54:12,553
There are vice-presidents on this list.

511
00:54:12,653 --> 00:54:15,853
Military and corporate leaders,
the vice-chancellor of Germany.

512
00:54:15,953 --> 00:54:17,531
So, why would Talia have this?

513
00:54:17,631 --> 00:54:21,662
What if Talia got to the men and women
on that list, brainwashed them?

514
00:54:21,912 --> 00:54:25,451
Then that would place the League
of Shadows' influence in every country.

515
00:54:25,551 --> 00:54:27,688
She'd control the world.

516
00:54:27,788 --> 00:54:30,725
My God, kid, your mom's got game.

517
00:54:31,225 --> 00:54:34,328
And all the leaders she would need
are at the summit...

518
00:54:34,428 --> 00:54:36,906
along with Bruce Wayne.

519
00:54:48,808 --> 00:54:50,615
Master...

520
00:54:56,249 --> 00:54:59,290
- Status?
- Just a second.

521
00:55:00,486 --> 00:55:02,922
Activating power boost.

522
00:55:03,022 --> 00:55:05,025
You're on, Tetch.

523
00:55:05,325 --> 00:55:08,140
Beginning brain wave synchronization.

524
00:55:08,240 --> 00:55:11,899
<i>So many minds. So little time.</i>

525
00:55:11,999 --> 00:55:14,134
And a new age dawns.

526
00:55:14,234 --> 00:55:17,542
Even Ra's Al Ghul couldn't achieve this.

527
00:55:20,539 --> 00:55:24,644
<i>Hey, Batwing, need a ride in the...
Batwing?</i>

528
00:55:24,744 --> 00:55:26,767
<i>Very funny.</i>

529
00:55:27,563 --> 00:55:29,083
You sure they won't know we're coming?

530
00:55:29,183 --> 00:55:31,819
<i>Not once we jam their radar
and shut down the alarm system.</i>

531
00:55:32,019 --> 00:55:33,937
Good thing you got us those schematics.

532
00:55:34,237 --> 00:55:37,712
<i>Hope my dad understands
when he finds out I hacked his computer.</i>

533
00:55:39,058 --> 00:55:42,157
- Got 'em.
- Engaging auto-pilot.

534
00:56:10,389 --> 00:56:13,349
Heads up, looks like we've got company.

535
00:56:18,698 --> 00:56:20,767
How long, Kuttler?

536
00:56:20,867 --> 00:56:24,704
- Twenty minutes at most.
- Make it 10.

537
00:56:24,804 --> 00:56:26,807
Get it.

538
00:56:26,907 --> 00:56:29,213
I brought you a little something.

539
00:56:40,586 --> 00:56:42,856
We've got to find the dignitaries
and evacuate them.

540
00:56:43,156 --> 00:56:44,224
What about Father?

541
00:56:44,324 --> 00:56:46,693
Our first priority is getting
those people out.

542
00:56:46,793 --> 00:56:48,633
Not mine.

543
00:57:01,574 --> 00:57:06,083
We don't have time for this, Damian.
Join us or die.

544
00:57:08,247 --> 00:57:09,554
Father.

545
00:57:29,635 --> 00:57:33,474
<i>The League of Shadows
compels you to be one with us.</i>

546
00:57:33,674 --> 00:57:35,943
<i>There is no you.</i>

547
00:57:36,043 --> 00:57:39,785
<i>You have no home. You have no people.</i>

548
00:59:31,257 --> 00:59:32,667
That can't be good.

549
00:59:45,371 --> 00:59:49,309
<i>You are the League of Shadows
and it is your home.</i>

550
00:59:49,409 --> 00:59:53,480
- <i>We are your people.</i>
- About time you came back.

551
00:59:53,580 --> 00:59:55,619
Indeed.

552
01:00:03,928 --> 01:00:05,384
Come on!

553
01:00:07,361 --> 01:00:08,603
No!

554
01:00:13,499 --> 01:00:15,486
Justice!

555
01:00:15,586 --> 01:00:17,875
Not vengeance.

556
01:00:25,378 --> 01:00:27,013
Damn.

557
01:00:27,113 --> 01:00:28,949
<i>Batwing to Robin.</i>

558
01:00:29,049 --> 01:00:31,288
Got a situation here.

559
01:00:32,099 --> 01:00:36,414
I need you to manually transfer power from
the damaged thruster to the remaining two.

560
01:00:38,424 --> 01:00:41,092
Oh, crap! Dad's gonna kill me.

561
01:00:51,988 --> 01:00:54,066
Big dirty...

562
01:01:34,814 --> 01:01:38,389
- <i>The League of Shadows...</i>
- Shut it down.

563
01:02:09,766 --> 01:02:12,043
Bloody hell.

564
01:02:37,843 --> 01:02:41,709
<i>Cutting it kinda close! Hurry up, kid!</i>

565
01:03:32,464 --> 01:03:36,859
Well done, beloved.
We will at least have this victory.

566
01:03:41,140 --> 01:03:42,966
Finish him.

567
01:03:46,446 --> 01:03:50,040
Bruce! Don't.

568
01:03:50,183 --> 01:03:53,884
That's what it's all about in the end,
isn't it, Mother?

569
01:03:54,054 --> 01:03:57,224
Not the vision of a better world
my grandfather had.

570
01:03:57,324 --> 01:03:59,059
It's just about control.

571
01:03:59,359 --> 01:04:02,829
Start with the bastard.
We can always make more.

572
01:04:02,929 --> 01:04:04,806
Bruce...

573
01:04:04,906 --> 01:04:08,739
you don't kill. You've never killed.

574
01:04:09,269 --> 01:04:13,540
Don't let her win.
Don't let her take your soul.

575
01:04:13,640 --> 01:04:17,844
If anything, I have cleansed it.
I washed away his trauma.

576
01:04:18,744 --> 01:04:21,051
Finish them.

577
01:04:21,647 --> 01:04:25,152
You brought us all together
because you understood our pain...

578
01:04:25,252 --> 01:04:28,088
our loneliness better
than anyone else could.

579
01:04:28,188 --> 01:04:32,490
We needed family. We needed you.

580
01:04:34,093 --> 01:04:39,504
- Shoot him!
- You're not just a mask. You're a man.

581
01:04:45,904 --> 01:04:48,420
The best man I've ever known.

582
01:04:51,244 --> 01:04:53,797
- No!
- Can't fight it.

583
01:04:53,897 --> 01:04:59,339
Yes, you can, damn it! For the little boy
who lost his world in that alley.

584
01:04:59,752 --> 01:05:01,779
Enough!

585
01:05:11,497 --> 01:05:13,565
I'm sorry.

586
01:05:13,665 --> 01:05:15,818
I'm so sorry.

587
01:05:17,219 --> 01:05:19,260
It's all right, Father.

588
01:05:23,969 --> 01:05:26,284
That's for what you did
to my father, bitch!

589
01:05:29,515 --> 01:05:31,384
It's over, Mother.

590
01:05:31,484 --> 01:05:33,954
Your grand plan has ended.

591
01:05:34,054 --> 01:05:36,256
How is it I ever loved either of you?

592
01:05:36,356 --> 01:05:41,344
- I don't think you ever did.
- Oh, beloved, you have no idea.

593
01:05:41,444 --> 01:05:45,392
I have thought of little else
for the last 12 years.

594
01:05:45,732 --> 01:05:49,019
But nothing, not my passion,

595
01:05:49,119 --> 01:05:51,338
not the death of my father,

596
01:05:51,438 --> 01:05:54,774
not even our child
could bring you to my side.

597
01:05:54,874 --> 01:05:59,646
I know now,
I will never have you in this life.

598
01:05:59,746 --> 01:06:03,017
- But perhaps, in death.
- Get her!

599
01:06:18,847 --> 01:06:20,988
She played us again.

600
01:07:01,673 --> 01:07:03,573
From what Nightwing said,

601
01:07:03,673 --> 01:07:06,479
once the programming is broken,
it can't be reset.

602
01:07:06,579 --> 01:07:10,550
Not yours, not anybody's.

603
01:07:10,650 --> 01:07:13,658
Well, I suppose Tetch could've done it,
if he hadn't lost his head.

604
01:07:15,887 --> 01:07:18,057
I'm proud of you, Kate.

605
01:07:18,157 --> 01:07:21,515
Gabrielle and Elizabeth
would be proud, too.

606
01:07:22,194 --> 01:07:24,335
I hope so.

607
01:07:27,599 --> 01:07:30,736
I'm a... a little early.

608
01:07:30,836 --> 01:07:34,545
No, no. You're right on time.

609
01:07:51,323 --> 01:07:53,739
I'm heading to the tower.

610
01:07:54,593 --> 01:07:57,301
Thanks for lunch, Alfred.

611
01:07:58,997 --> 01:08:01,034
- What's going on?
- Master Bruce is having

612
01:08:01,134 --> 01:08:03,670
a heart-to-heart with Damian.

613
01:08:03,770 --> 01:08:05,952
One can't help feeling bad.

614
01:08:06,052 --> 01:08:10,796
Despite her madness, she was his mother.

Whenever your game is ready to be distributed, you probably want to ditribute a copy of the blenderplayer you use. Just copy the files from your blender directory here. You can delete some unesscesary files (blender.exe, datafiles, etc...)

The launcher may also work even if you don't distribute a copy of blenderplayer, it will look for a copy of Blender in the computer and use it instead.
